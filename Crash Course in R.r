1. Assignment

The key to assignment in R is the arrow operator (<-) for assignment.

Below are examples of assigning an integer, double, string and a boolean, and printing each out to the console in turn.

> # integer
> i <- 23
> i
[1] 23

> # double
> d <- 2.3
> d
[1] 2.3

> # string
> s <- 'hello world'
> s
[1] "hello world"

> # boolean
> b <- TRUE
> b
[1] TRUE



2. Data Structures

There three data structures that you will use the most in R:

Vectors
Lists
Matrices
Data Frames

Lists
Lists provide a group of named items, not unlike a map.

# create a list of named items
a <- list(aa=1, bb=2, cc=3)
a
a$aa

# add a named item to a list
a$dd=4
a

You can define a new list with the list() function. A list can be initialized with values or empty. 
Note that the named values in the list can be accessed using the dollar operator ($). Once 
referenced, they can be read or written. This is also how new items can be added to the list.


Vectors
Vectors are lists of data that can be the same or different types:

> # create a vector using the c() function
> v <- c(98, 99, 100)
> v
[1]  98  99 100
> v[1:2]
[1] 98 99
 
> # create a vector from a range of integers
> r <- (1:10)
> r
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> r[5:10]
[1]  5  6  7  8  9 10
 
> # add a new item to the end of a vector
> v <- c(1, 2, 3)
> v[4] <- 4
> v
[1] 1 2 3 4


Notice that vectors are 1-index (indexes start at 1 not 0).

You will use the c() function a lot to concatenate variables into a vector.



Matrices
A matrix is a table of data. It has dimensions (rows and columns) and the columns can be named.

# Create a 2-row, 3-column matrix with named headings
> data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
> headings <- list(NULL, c("a","b","c"))
> m <- matrix(data, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE, dimnames=headings)
> m
     a b c
[1,] 1 2 3
[2,] 4 5 6

> m[1,]
a b c 
1 2 3 

> m[,1]
[1] 1 4

A lot of useful plotting and machine learning algorithms require the data to be provide as a matrix.

Note the syntax to index into rows [1,] and columns [,1] of a matrix.



Data Frame
Data frames are useful for actually representing tables of your data in R.

# create a new data frame
years <- c(1980, 1985, 1990)
scores <- c(34, 44, 83)
df <- data.frame(years, scores)
df[,1]
df$years


A matrix is much simpler structure, intended for mathematical operations. A data frame is 
more suited to representing a table of data and is expected by modern implementations of 
machine learning algorithms in R.

Note that you can index into rows and columns of a data frame just like you can for a matrix. 
Also note that you can reference a column using its name (df$years)

Some other data structures you could go on to learn about are lists and arrays.



3. Flow Control
R supports all the same flow control structures that you are used to.

If-Then-Else
For Loop
While Loop
As a developer, these are all self explanatory.

If-Then-Else

# if then else
a <- 66
if (a > 55) {
	print("a is more than 55")
} else {
	print("A is less than or equal to 55")
}

[1] "a is more than 55"


For Loop

# for loop
mylist <- c(55, 66, 77, 88, 99)
for (value in mylist) {
	print(value)
}

[1] 55
[1] 66
[1] 77
[1] 88
[1] 99

While Loop

# while loop
a <- 100
while (a < 500) {
	a <- a + 100
}
a

[1] 500



4. Functions
Functions let you group code and call that code repeatedly with arguments.

The two main concerns with functions are:

Calling Functions
Help For Functions
Writing Custom Functions
Call Functions
You have already used one function, the c() function for concatenating objects into a vector.

R has many built in functions and additional functions can be provided by installing and 
loading third-party packages.

Here is an example of using a statistical function to calculate the mean of a vector of 
numbers:

# call function to calculate the mean on a vector of integers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
mean(numbers)

[1] 3.5

Help for Functions
You can help help with a function in R by using the question mark operator (?) followed by the 
function name.

# help with the mean() function
?mean
help(mean)

Alternatively, you can call the help() function and pass the function name you need help with 
as an argument (e.g. help(mean)).

You can get example usage of a function by calling the example() function and passing the 
name of the function as an argument.


# example usage of the mean function
example(mean)

Custom Functions
You can define your own functions that may or may not take arguments or return a result.

Below is an example of a custom function to calculate and return the sum of three numbers:

# define custom function
mysum <- function(a, b, c) {
	sum <- a + b + c
	return(sum)
}
# call custom function
mysum(1,2,3)

[1] 6


5. Packages
Packages are the way that third party R code is distributed. The Comprehensive R Archive 
Network (CRAN) provides hosting and listing of third party R packages that you can 
download.

Install a Package
You can install a package hosted on CRAN by calling a function. It will then pop-up a dialog to 
ask you which mirror you would like to download the package from.

For example, here is how you can install the caret package which is very useful in machine 
learning:

# install the caret package
install.packages("caret")
# load the package
library(caret)

Help For Package
A package can provide a lot of new functions. You can read up on a package on itâ€™s CRAN 
page, but you can also get help for the package within R using the library function.

# help for the caret package
library(help="caret")


5 Things To Remember
Here are five quick tips to remember when getting started in R:

Assignment. R uses the arrow operator (<-) for assignment, not a single equals (=).
Case Sensitive. The R language is case sensitive, meaning that C() and c() are two 
different function calls.
Help. You can help on any operator or function using the help() function or the ? 
operator and help with packages using the double question mark operator (??).
How To Quit. You can exit the R interactive environment by calling the q() function.
Documentation. R installs with a lot of useful documentation. You can review it in the 
browser by typing: help.start()
